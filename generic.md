					<h3>First:Identity</h3>
					<blockquote><span style="max-width: 18%" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/pic12.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>My students' identity is sacred. They are whole as they are, and need neither molding nor to be told what to think. We work to help them make better decisions for themselves, not for us to make better decisions for them. In addition, through my relationship with them, I express criticism or support of their identity, whether intentional or not, and in turn, this makes my relationship with them equally sacred. I cherish the connections I make and strive make better ones.

					<h3>Second:Discovery</h3>
					<blockquote>I personally should embody the very same goals and hopes I have for my students, that I should embrace curiosity about the world as a lifestyle and an everyday re-commitment, and that I should continue exploring my own science 
					(and personal) identity through self-reflection and experimentation with new roles. I do this all publicly, for my classroom to see, as a means of showing them this is a safe place, not only for them to be who they are, but for them to, like me, try new things.</blockquote>
				</div>
				<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
					<h3>Third:Leadership</h3>
					<blockquote>Students are the ones asking the questions; they are the ones organizing the investigations; they are the ones thinking critically about the answers. My classroom is an opportunity for students to practice being leaders. My classroom is designed to facilitate that by providing as many options as possible and giving students the choices. What kind of options? Options for how to organize, how to approach challenges, how to sit, how to play, how to communicate, and how to learn.</blockquote>
