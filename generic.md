Learning is and always has been the guiding star of my life, and I dream 
about all the new opportunities the world has for me. It is both my 
means, a skill mastered over countless hours, and my end, to understand the world, its people, its languages, its physics, and endless 
nuances. This affords me the opportunity to take on new 
challenges daily, each presenting a new opportunity to grow.
