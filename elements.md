		<h3>Kinematics of Super Mario World</h3>
		<h4>Students will examine concepts of position, velocity, and acceleration by designing investigations on a Super Mario World simulation</h4>
		<h5>New York Science Physical Setting Standard 4 (Regents)</h5>
		<p><span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><iframe width="150" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQjiPr5Sl5c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>Students are presented with a series of slow-motion videos in which Super Peach attempts to make some kind of jump. Students are prompted to investigate the game engine, and design an investigation to gather data and using evidence, make a case for 'making it' or 'not making it'. Lesson is making use of inquiry based design; students will  provide models, collect and analyze data, and communicate their findings to the class. Students are assessed on model formation, revision, data collection procedure, data analaysis, and the finally conclusion by means of a lab notebook</p>

		<h3>10 Mile Meter</h3>
		<h4>Students will explore vehicle design from mechanical and kinematic perspectives while designing solutions to a challenge</h4>
		<h5>NGSS HS-ETS1-2, HS-ETS1-3.</h5>
		<p><span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><iframe width="150" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aa0Rr_BITbE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
			Students are challenged to develop a vehicle which can travel 1 meter, under the stipulation that they are not given any motors, only servos that rotate up to 180 degrees. They work in groups to research servos, mechanics of animal and vehicle motion, and coding (arduino), to develop a final product that can travel the meter. They test their device, make revisions and recommendations based off of its performance and present to their community their findings. Students are assessed on their ability to present a unified project report, detailing their research, improvisations, consequences, and ultimate result.

		<h3>Panera and Permeability</h3>
		<h4>Students will examine concepts of porosity, permiability, and capillarity by designing investigations on types of bread</h4>
		<h5>New York Science Scope and Squence Earth Science Unit 4/NGSS HS-ESS2-5</h5>
		<p><span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson1-PPC/WDYS-nontransparent.png %}" alt="" /></span>Students make observations about a variety of different loaves of bread. They document them, with special attention to the languages they use. Students use their observations to design an investigation into 'soup absorption'--which type of bread and which qualities makes for the most soup (or water) absorbing bread</p>
		<span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson1-PPC/PPCvocab-nontransparent.png %}" alt="" /></span>students are finally given the academic vocabulary necessary to describe the phenomenon. They are given a second phenomenon (this time a digital model) mechanically similar to the first, but this time at a higher, more abstract, more 'academic' level making use of science vocabulary. Students bridge the gap between the two, comparing the vocabulary they used in the first phase to the vocabulary usere in the digital model.</p>
		
			Finally, students are tasked in groups with teaching what their were just taught through an artifact, a "Teachback." They are informed to make it accessible to a group younger than they are. In groups, they develop either:
			<ul>
				<li>a book</li>
				<li>a video game</li>
				<li>a short movie</li>
				<li>a song</li>
				<li>an infographic</li>
				<li>a model</li>
			</ul>

			Recipes are included for no-baking soda, normal baking soda, and extra baking soda bread, to create a gradient of porosity students will examine and test. There is also instruction for creating channels using laminated butter, for another gradient varying permeability.

		<h3>Riding the River</h3>
		<h4>Students will examine concepts of river erosion by examining Mario Kart racing physics</h4>
		<h5>New York Science Scope and Squence Earth Science Unit 4/NGSS HS-ESS2-5</h5>
		<p><span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbkJugm4OGk"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson2-RiverErosion/mk_edited.gif %}" alt="" /></a></span>In Mario Kart, when racers take turns around the track, the racers on the inside of the turn make progress moreso than the racers on the outside (grounding phenomenon), and the students will be exploring this. It makes use of primary materials, a running copy of Mario Kart, and then, during an observation segment, has students document what they saw in the game using what they already know, with special attention to the language used. Students are given a lab template with which to design their own investigation, testing the properties objects moving in arcs. The template and rubric (which they are also given) guides them naturally to develop along Argument Driven Inquiry lines</p>
		<p><span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson2-RiverErosion/vocabErosion-nontransparent.png %}" alt="" /></span>Students are finally given the academic vocabulary necessary to describe the phenomenon. They are given a second phenomenon, a river bend model, mechanically similar to the first, but this time using more 'academic' science vocabulary. Students bridge the gap between the two, comparing the vocabulary they used in the first and second phases.Finally, students are tasked in groups with teaching what their were just taught through an artifact, a "Teachback." They are informed to make it accessible to a group younger than they are. In groups, they develop either:

		<h3>Quest</h3>
		<h4>Exam prep game that lasts all year</h4>
		<h5>New York Science Scope and Squence Earth Science Unit 3/NGSS HS-ESS2-5 (flexible)</h5>
		<p><span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson3-LandformsReview/desert.png %}" alt="" /></span>This is a game students play before each major exam, for reviewing key unit topics. Students take on roles, and cooperate to solve Earth science questions in an elaborate narrative. They use powers to elicit help, support friends, and backstab enemies and the whole structure supports a myriad of ways to participate. In addition, there is continuity across review sessions throughout the year, and a larger story that operates as a metaphor for self growth across the year.</p>
		<p><span style="max-width: 15%;" class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson3-LandformsReview/mara.png %}" alt="" /></span>As mentioned, each student gets to pick a specific role. These were designed with diversity and inclusion in mind, and have representations according to my high needs classroom, including hispanic, black, and LGBTQ presenting characters. Characters also reflect a diversity through their mechanics, enabling students to participate in ways they specifically want to. Some characters allow students to get up and move around, others encourage sociability, and some have more thoughtful personalities. This is a ever developing game and one of the ways it continuously grows is through adding in more characters cards to reflect new representations of my students' identities.<span style="max-width: 15%;" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson3-LandformsReview/hespa.png %}" alt="" /></span>
		While designing this game, my classroom struggled to collaborate; my students siloed or disengaged during any kind of group content. This game has a design goal of improving collaboration in my classroom; it provides heavy incentive for engaging not only in the questions but with fellow players in new ways. For example, it may reward a player for betraying their friends and reward them for making new ones.</p>
		<p>
			Students start out at the beginning of the year in groups of four, that may or may not change throughout the year according to the story and events. Materials include a Pear deck set of slides that reflect the narrative, high resolution character cards for printing and sleeving, dice, and tokens. Exact details as to the rules and how to play are also included. There is a special slide in the slide deck, called the Save Slide, where students record their status and progress through the story, so they can pick it up again next time.<!--<span style="max-width: 30%;" class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/lessons-assets/Lesson3-LandformsReview/save-nonstransparent.png %}" alt="" /></span>-->
