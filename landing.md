					<h3>Macro Photography</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I've been doing macro photography since I was a teenager, with a second-hand DSLR and a backyard. Realizing I could detach my lens and hold it backwards was one of the most formative moments of my life back then. My favorite things to photograph are microflora like mosses and molds but I photograph a little of everything. When I see colors or a structure I think is interesting, I bring out the camera. Ask me to show off some of my photos!</p>

					<h3>Making</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I'm an active member of my local makerspace, HackManhattan, where I explore and make all manner of things. Most recently, I have been working on a "healing stones: unveiled" series of science demonstrations that show off the real science of popular stones for healing. For example, I've polished Selenite, a popular spiritual healing stone, <a href="assets/images/selenite.jpg">until it has a TV effect</a>. I'm also working on a form of encoding that can only read through the birefringence property of Quartzite. I also recently made a jacket that glows in rhythm with my heartbeat.  Next up: making it bluetooth compatible so I can also make it glow in rhythm with music.</p>

					<h3>Video Editing/Production</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I have a dream of starting my own educational web series, and, while I prepare for that, I always jump at opprtunities to practice and explore new editing techniques. I've made my own video series on Calculus, I've made music videos; I've also done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nfaOlJlYek">some video journalism</a> for the Peace Corps (I'm an RPCV). You can my channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/treknique/videos">here</a>.</p>
